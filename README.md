# Bytework-assessment

**The above Repository Contains AL/ML assessment from byteworks and it is comprises of 3 Modules, which are all In a Jupyter Notebook.**

The Note book are arranged based on the order of the Question in the assessment

* **Question 1** : Numpy Notebook
* **Question 2** : Swarm Behaviour Research Case Notebook
* **Question 3** :   Design a deep learning model architecture suitable for the above
*  **Question 4** : Train and evaluate your case-study on the designed simple deep learning model architecture in III

!!! Note Question 3 and 4 share the same notebook

# Steps on How to Run the above repository:

1. Clone the above Repo using the git command "git clone https://github.com/okoliechykwuka/Bytework-assessment.git" to your pc using a cmd interface
2. Specify the part to the **Swarm Behaviour** data for Question 2,3,4
3. Click *Run all** command on jupyter notebook to execute the note
4. For Question 4 we, I already saved the pretrained model to dict, you can load the pretrained model using 
   `model2 = model.load_state_dict(torch.load('swarm-logistic.pth'))` to evaluate the model on test or validation dataset
